#Variable Naming Practice

Descriptive and meaningful. Variable names should be consitent and
reveal the intention clearly. This makes code more readable and
understandable. 

Further, underscores between words in variable names, and spaces after the variable name and before the value will help keep code 
readable. 

#Debugging Common Mistakes

Missing colon/semi-colon (colon in python)
Missing or mismatched delimiters (parentheses, braces, brackets, quotes)
Typos in keywords or identifiers. 
Using assignment (=) instead of equality (==)
Undeclared or redeclared variables.
